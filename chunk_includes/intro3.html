<b>Instructions</b>
</p>


<p>
Throughout the experiment, you should always keep your hands positioned so that your index fingers are on the 'F' and 'J' keys and your middle fingers are on 'E' and 'I'.
  This will allow you to respond faster. You will not be able to respond with your mouse.
</p>
<p>
At this point, before we start the experiment, we would like to ask that you <b>maximize your browser window and close any windows that might distract you.</b><br>
  The sentences go by quickly and we want to make sure you see them propoerly and stay focused.<br>
</p>
