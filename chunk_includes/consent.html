This study is being done by Dr. Brian Dillon from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><u>Why are we doing this research study?<o:p></o:p></u><br>
The purpose of this research study is to understand how English speakers understand complex sentences. 
We will attempt to understand this by asking you questions about your interpretation of different sentences, or your judgments of how natural they seem. 
We may also measure how long it takes to understand words in a sentence while you read it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><u>Who can participate in this research study?<o:p></o:p></u><br>
In order to be eligible to participate in this study, you must be a native speaker of English and have no history of language or reading disorders. 
You must be at least 18 years old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><u>What will I be asked to do and how much time will it take?<o:p></o:p></u><br>
If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to read sentences on a computer screen. 
After reading each sentence, you will be asked to answer a question about it by pressing a button on the keyboard. 
We will record your responses and your response times. 
As part of the experiment, you will be presented with a few short questions about your demographics and language history.<br>
The whole experimental session should take 30 minutes, start to finish. You will not be contacted in the future.

exactly'><u>Will being in this research study help me in any way?<o:p></o:p></u><br>
You will not directly benefit from this research; however, we hope that your participation in the study may help us better understand the processes involved in language comprehension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><u>What are my risks of being in this research study?<o:p></o:p></u><br>
There is a minimal risk of discomfort from remaining seated. 
There are only minimal risks to social and psychological wellbeing, as all language materials have been edited to remove inflammatory content. 
There is no risk to your economic wellbeing. 
With online surveys, a risk of a breach of confidentiality always exists. 
However, we have taken steps to minimize this risk, as we describe below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><u>How will my personal information be protected?<o:p></o:p></u><br>
The following procedures will be used to protect the confidentiality of your study records. 
First, we will not record any link between your data and you as an individual. 
This removes the risk that your responses and data can be linked to you as an individual. 
At the conclusion of this study, the researchers may publish their findings. 
Information will be presented in summary format and you will not be identified in any publications or presentations, though de-identified data will be released along with those publications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><u>Will I be given any money or other compensation for being in this research study?<o:p></o:p></u><br>
You will be compensated with either a gift card worth 6USD, or with $6 through Prolific if you were recruited through this platform. 
If you are compensated for your participation in this study, your personal information may be released to accounting officials. 
If payment to a research participant is $600 or more in any one calendar year, the University of Massachusetts, Amherst is required to report this information to the IRS as taxable income. 
This information will be kept confidential and will only be used to process payment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><u>What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?<o:p></o:p></u><br>
You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to. 
If you agree to be in the study, but later change your mind, you may drop out at any time. 
There are no penalties or consequences of any kind if you decide that you do not want to participate.</p>
