<b>Instructions</b>
</p>

<p>
At the end each trial, you'll be asked a question about the sentence you have just read. You will be asked to choose the correct answer from four alternative answers that will appear on screen along with the question.
</p>
<p>
&emsp;&thinsp;To choose the response on the upper left, use the '<b>E</b>' key.
<br>&emsp;&thinsp;To choose the response on the upper right, use the '<b>I</b>' key.
<br>&emsp;To choose the response on the bottom left, use the '<b>F</b>' key.
<br>&emsp;To choose the response on the bottom right, use the '<b>J</b>' key.
</p>
<p>
We chose these keys for the task so that you can respond quickly by resting your hand on the keyboard such that your index fingers are on 'F' and 'J', your middle fingers are on 'E' and 'I', and your thumbs on the spacebar (for initiating new sentence trials).
</p>
<p>
After chosing your response to the question, the trial will end, and a new cross ("+") will appear to indicate that the next sentence is ready for dispaly.</p>
