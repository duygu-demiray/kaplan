<b>Instructions</b>
</p>
<p>

Welcome! In this experiment, you'll be reading English sentences and answer one comprehension question after each sentence.
</p>
<p>
The sentences you read will be presented to you automatically, word by word, at a steady pace. It'll seem a bit fast at first, but you'll get used to it quickly. 
  It's about as fast as people normally read words. 
</p>
<p>
Before each sentence, you will see a cross ("+") to indicate that you may begin a sentence. When you see the cross, get ready to read a sentence. 
  When you are ready to start reading, hit the spacebar and the sentence will unfold automatically.
</p>
<p>How do you start a sentence?<br>
<input name="start" type="radio" value="automatically" class="obligatory" id="automatically" /><label for="automatically">It starts automatically</label>
                   <br><input name="start" type="radio" value="space bar" id="space bar"/><label for="space bar">Hit the space bar</label>
</p>
<p>How will new words appear?<br>
<input name="question1" type="radio" value="wordbyword" class="obligatory" id="q1wordbyword" /><label for="q1wordbyword">One by one, automatically</label>
                   <br><input name="question1" type="radio" value="spacebar" id="spacebar"/><label for="spacebar">One word with each button press</label>
